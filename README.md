# Autonomous-pH-Regulation-using-Raspberry Pi

The goal of this project is to create an automated pH regulation system on a miniature Hydroponic garden(Nutrient Film Technique/Deep Water Culture hybrid system) using a pH probe, two dosing pumps, and a touchscreen display.  

The pH probe will be inserted into the reservoir and it will take constant readings of the water's pH. If the pH probe detects that the reservoir's pH level rises above or falls below a certain threshold programmed by the user, the dosing pumps will dispense small amounts of pH up or pH down solution in between intervals of pH readings until pH is back within the desired range.

Touchscreen Display will display the current pH readings as well as the user-determined upper and lower limits for pH. It will also display a GUI that allows user to change the upper and lower limits for pH through touchscreen interaction.
